# RE_LE_NMR_data

NMR data characterizing DNA hairpins RE and LE.

**LE_off-resonance-R1rho:** processed off-resonance R1rho data for selectively 13C/15N A12-T9 labeled LE DNA. A12(C8), A12(C2), T9(C6), T9(C1') probes were measured at 900 MHz at different temperatures.

**RE_off-resonance-R1rho:** processed off-resonance R1rho data for selectively 13C/15N A12-T9 labeled RE DNA. A12(C8), A12(C2), A12(C1'), T9(C6), T9(C1') probes were measured at 900 and 600 MHz at different temperatures.
